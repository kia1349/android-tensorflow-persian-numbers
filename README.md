## Getting Started

Just clone the project.

### Prerequisites

If you want to build your own image classifier you shoud install Tensorflow on your pc furthermore you need your own dataset.
Note: python (version 3.+) required.

this command are for windows users:
```
C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
```
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
```
C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```
**Installing with Anaconda:**
1. Follow the instructions on the [Anaconda download site](https://www.continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda download site") to download and install Anaconda.
2. Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:
```
C:> conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.5 
```
3. Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:
```
C:> activate tensorflow
 (tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change 
```
4. Issue the appropriate command to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
```
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow 
```
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command (on a single line):
```
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu 
```
